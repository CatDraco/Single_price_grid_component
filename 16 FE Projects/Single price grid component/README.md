## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

As this was my first project that I have coded on my own I learned a great deal about grid.  This project reinforced my studies, but also challenged me to learn how to keep the columns equal sizes with these lines of CSS code:

```css
.grid-container {
    grid-auto-columns: 1fr;
    grid-auto-flow: column; 
  }
```

I also had trouble duplicating some of the colors that weren't specifically called out in the design notes, so I found ColorPick Eyedropper to be an invaluable tool.

### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing on HTML/CSS/JS in future projects.

### Useful resources

ColorPick Eyedropper - This is a very good tool for picking colors from a website. I found it very easy to use and had the color formats I needed

https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp - This site was my main go-to for CSS properties.  It does a pretty good job of explaining things and allows you to experiment with the code a bit.
